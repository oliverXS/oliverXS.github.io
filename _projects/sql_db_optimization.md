This project aims to have a comprehensive and practical implementation for optimizing the performance of SQL databases. By following a step-by-step approach, this project covers various techniques and strategies to enhance database performance and improve overall efficiency. Key areas of focus include the addition of indexes to accelerate query execution, the utilization of caching mechanisms such as Redis to alleviate server load during peak usage, implementation of read/write splitting for optimized data retrieval and storage, and exploration of horizontal sharding and partitioning techniques for efficient data insertion. Additionally, the project addresses the importance of router policies and global IDs in a multi-database and multi-table environment, offering insights into efficient data routing and load balancing. With the goal of empowering developers and database administrators, this project provides practical guidance, code examples, and best practices to optimize SQL database performance and deliver a seamless user experience.
